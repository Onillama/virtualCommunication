                        Types of network technology refer to different methods,
                        protocols, and technologies used to establish and manage
                        communication between devices within a network.</p>

                            devices within a limited geographical area, such as
                            a home, office building, or campus. It allows
                            devices like computers, printers, and servers to
                            share resources and communicate with each

                        <div class="def">
                            A WAN is a network that spans a large geographical
                            area, typically connecting multiple LANs or
                            individual devices over long distances. It enables
                            communication between devices located in different
                            cities, countries, or continents, often using leased
                            lines or public infrastructure like the internet.

                        <div class="def">
                            A WLAN is a type of LAN that uses wireless
                            communication technology, such as Wi-Fi, to connect
                            devices within a limited area. It eliminates the
                            need for physical cables and enables mobility for
                            devices like laptops, smartphones, and tablets.

                            A MAN is a network that spans a larger geographical
                            area than a LAN but smaller than a WAN, typically
                            covering a city or metropolitan area. It provides
                            high-speed connectivity to connect multiple LANs and
                            support services like broadband internet access and
                            digital TV broadcasting.

                            A PAN is a network that connects personal devices
                            within a short range, typically within a person's
                            immediate vicinity, such as a smartphone, tablet,
                            laptop, or wearable device. It enables communication
                            and data exchange between personal devices for tasks
                            like file sharing, device synchronization, and
                            wireless peripheral connectivity.

                            A CAN is a network that interconnects multiple LANs
                            within a university campus, corporate campus, or
                            large institution. It provides high-speed
                            connectivity to support communication between
                            departments, research facilities, and administrative

                            like computers, smart TVs, home automation systems,
                            and IoT devices to communicate with each other and
                            access shared resources like internet connectivity

                        A VPN is a secure network connection established over a
                        public network, typically the internet, to enable remote
                        users or branch offices to access a private network
                        securely. It encrypts data transmitted over the network
                        to protect it from unauthorized access and interception.
