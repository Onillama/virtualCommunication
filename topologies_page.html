                    <p>
                        Network topologies refer to the physical or logical
                        arrangement of devices and connections within a network.
                        Different topologies have their advantages and
                        disadvantages in terms of scalability, fault tolerance,
                        and performance</p>

                            <li>In a star topology, all devices are connected to a central hub or switch.</li>
                            <li>Devices communicate with each other through the central hub/switch.</li>
                            <li>It is easy to add or remove devices without disrupting the network.</li>

                           <li>In a bus topology, all devices are connected to a single central cable (the bus).</li>
                           <li>Devices communicate by sending data packets along the bus.</li>
                           <li>It is simple and inexpensive to implement.</li>
                           <li>However, if the central cable is damaged, the entire network may be affected.</li>

                           <li>Data packets travel in one direction around the ring.</li>
                           <li>It is relatively easy to manage and troubleshoot.</li>
                           <li>However, if one device or connection fails, the entire network may be disrupted.</li>

                         <li>In a mesh topology, each device is connected to every other device in the network.</li>
                         <li>It provides redundant paths for data transmission, improving fault tolerance and reliability.</li>
                         <li>It is suitable for critical applications where high availability is essential.</li>
                         <li>However, it is complex and expensive to implement, requiring a large number of connections.</li>

                          <li>A hybrid topology combines two or more basic topologies (e.g., star-bus, star-ring).</li>
                          <li>It allows for greater flexibility and customization to meet specific network requirements.</li>
                          <li>It can offer advantages of multiple topologies while mitigating their limitations.</li>
                          <li>However, it may be more complex to design and manage compared to basic topologies.</li>
