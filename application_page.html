                        Network technology applications refer to the practical
                        uses and implementations of network technology across
                        various domains and industries. These applications
                        leverage network infrastructure, protocols, hardware,
                        and software to address specific needs and requirements.
                        Here are some common network technology
                        applications.</p>

                            services, and communicate globally. Internet service
                            providers (ISPs) use network technology to provide
                            broadband and wireless internet connectivity to
                            homes, businesses, and public spaces.

                            is used to establish and manage internal networks
                            for connecting computers, servers, printers, and
                            other devices. Enterprise networks facilitate data
                            sharing, resource access, and communication among
                            employees, departments, and branches.

                            resources over the internet. Cloud services such as
                            infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a
                            service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS)
                            rely on network infrastructure to provide scalable,
                            flexible, and accessible solutions to users.
